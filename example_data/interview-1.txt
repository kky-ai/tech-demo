Hello, today is April 21st in the year 2023. I'm Karen Herman and I am delighted to be interviewing Deb Goodkin for the Free and Open Source Stories Digital Archive. So welcome and thank you so much for doing this. I'm very excited to be doing this with you today. And we're going to start right from the beginning, which is when and where were you born?

Oh, well, I was born in Hollywood, California. And I was born in 1961. And where did you grow up? So I grew up in Southern California. And so half my childhood was in Los Angeles. And then we moved to San Diego, which was great. And, and lived there until I graduated from college.

What did your parents do?

So my dad, it was always really hard to understand what he did. None of us kids really interested in it, not like he was in the CIA or anything. But he, he basically was in real estate, but helping large developers develop, like larger communities. And so he did that, as long as I knew, and was like, sort of known as an expert in that. And I worked for him when I was in high school, when I was in college, and he actually thought I would take over the business from him. And my mom worked until she had kids. And she wanted to be a doctor, and she would have been a great doctor, but she was a bacteriologist. And a lot of it was just because of the times.

And do you have any brothers or sisters? I have two older brothers. And do you have any brothers or So I have two older brothers. And what kind of kid were you? Um, Um, I guess if I think about that, I, um, I don't know if it was because I had brothers, but I was

very outdoorsy. And I always remember us kids just playing outside all the time. And I think growing up in Southern outside all the time. And I think growing up in Southern California, I mean, the weather was always beautiful. And so you could do that. And we had a swimming pool beautiful. And so you could do that. And we had a swimming pool at home. And so we in the summers, we swam. And I always remember my oldest brother was into filming. So he had this old camera, and then he would set us up, we would do like war scenes, all us up, we would do like war scenes, all sorts of things that we would play together. And we would play a lot of together. And so I think as a kid, I would have been referred to as a tomboy. But really, I mean, to me, that's just like being a kid, just being, you know, curious and active. And, and because when one of my brothers was much older than me, he would take me backpacking and river rafting and things like that. So, so it was a good childhood.

Did you have any idea what you wanted to be when you grew up?

I want there are a lot of things I wanted to be. And I think that's what made it hard. And, and my parents, they never encouraged me to be anything, but they never limited it. So they never made me feel like there was anything I couldn't do. So I mean, I went from wanting to be an astronaut to a veterinarian to, you know, I thought about being a doctor. So, so, you know, so, so it was nice being able to think about it or knowing I had those options. And but, but it took time narrowing down, you know, where, where I thought I should go.

Did, did you have any interest in computing or computers as a kid?

So, um, we didn't have a computer when I was growing up. So that was before home computers. And so I really, the only thing I knew about computers was really the word processors, which were fancy typewriters. And because my dad was also a writer, we had one at home. And so that was pretty novel. And but, but I didn't grow up with computers. So I didn't know anything, I really didn't know anything about them. And, and so it really wasn't until I went to college that I was exposed to computers. So really, before that, I mean, part of my growing up, and maybe because I had I had brothers too, I built a lot of things, I was really into, like building models, and we would build like, model cars and model airplanes and things like that. So I've always enjoyed that building things.

And where did you go to college?

I went to University of California in San Diego, and for my undergrad, and then I went to University of Santa Clara, up in Santa Clara, California. And what did you study? So for my undergrad, it was computer engineering, which was, at that time, it was part computer science and part electrical engineering. And then for my master's degree, I got a master's in electrical engineering.

It's interesting, because you said that you really didn't have, you didn't know anything about computers till you got to college. How did you then decide to major in it?

Yeah, I mean, that's a really good question. Because when I started college, actually, I was focused more on business, because like I said, before, the plan was really for me to take over my dad's business. But it wasn't something I was really interested in. And my mom actually helped me try to figure out what I was good at. And I grew up thinking, never thinking I was good at math, but my mom would always tell me how she was good at math. I don't even know why it would come up. But I knew that I knew my mom was good at math. And so I realized that I was also very good at math. And so in doing like an assessment test at that time, computer science, and engineering actually came up as a strength. And I thought, you know what, I, this would be a great major, because I could get a job. And so that was really why I went in that direction. direction.

And was there something specific that you studied? Um, Um, well, actually, I was really, so in the computer engineering, you get a lot of, you know, computer science theory, and

like understanding algorithms, and you learn a lot of different programming languages from, we actually started with punch cards, just to check them out. So I mean, at that time, you had Pascal and Fortran and BASIC. And we did, we wrote an assembly language, we wrote compilers, so a lot of software development, and as well as understanding theory, but also electrical engineering side, so circuits and in all in the typical types of classes that you would get in electrical engineering, I took math all four years, just because, as an elective, just because I was good at it. And, and so I made sure I always took a math class.

And so then you went to graduate school. Again, was there was there something that you wanted to do specifically, at that point?
